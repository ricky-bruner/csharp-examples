# C# Examples Repository
Welcome to the csharp-examples repository, a curated collection of C# projects that encapsulate the essence of software engineering practices, patterns, and principles I've embraced throughout my career. This repository is not a direct replication of my professional work but rather an homage to the learning and experiences gained across various roles, especially in backend development and ETL processes.

## Repository Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to showcase a range of applications and systems built with C# that reflect real-world scenarios and challenges I've encountered in the field. Each project within this repository is designed to highlight different aspects of software development, from data processing and manipulation to architectural patterns like Dependency Injection and strategic design patterns observed in my past roles.

## Projects Overview
Each project in this repository represents a unique aspect of C# development, emphasizing:

- **Best Practices**: Demonstrating coding standards, best practices, and clean code principles in C#.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizing various design patterns to solve common software design problems elegantly.
- **Modern C# Features**: Showcasing the use of modern C# features and .NET Core/NET 5+ advancements to build efficient, scalable applications.
- **Data Handling**: Illustrating efficient data handling, storage, and retrieval mechanisms, particularly with MongoDB, to manage and process large volumes of data.
- **Dependency Injection**: Implementing Dependency Injection to decouple components and enhance testability and maintainability of the applications.

## Projects:
- **Interval Processing**:
One notable example is the "Interval Processing" project, which serves as a server-side application for generating text file reports from data stored in MongoDB collections. This project embodies my approach to this type of ETL-like process, employing Dependency Injection and various design patterns to create a flexible, modular, and easily maintainable system. It's designed to run as a one-off process, ideal for scheduling with tools like AWS CloudWatch for periodic execution.
